3.1 What Is a Control Structure?

Control flow is the order that instructions are executed in a program. A control statement is a statement
that determines the control fl ow of a set of instructions. 
There are three fundamental forms of control that programming languages provideâ€” sequential control , selection control , and iterative control.

Sequential control is an implicit form of control in which instructions are executed in the
order that they are written

A selection control statement is a control statement providing selective execution of instructions.
A selection control structure is a given set of instructions and the selection control statement(s)
controlling their execution
